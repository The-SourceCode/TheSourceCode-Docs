# About Us
TheSourceCode Education is platform designed to help walk you through some of the most challenging points of your development...which is usaully the beginning. Most of the time people give up on learning something just because they are struggling to get past the initial learning curve. We are hoping on our documents site that we can help you get over that hump. In addition to having our documents site we have a [Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/thesourcecodetutorials) and a [Discord](https://discord.thesourcecode.dev) where you can get additional help.

# Why a docs site?
We understand that learning to code from a video can be extremely hard and not the right fit for everyone. So we have decided to start putting all of our code from our videos into text form. This will also continue with any new *Tutorial* based videeos.
